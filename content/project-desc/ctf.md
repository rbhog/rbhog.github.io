I was introduced to CTF through what was at the time called CSAW HSF (High School Forensics). The premise of the competition was a qualifying round which consisted of Jeopardy-style puzzles across categories ranging from cryptography to binary exploitation which led to a finals round consisting of a forensics challenge where teams are given a clue to start with and finally submit a writeup describing vulnerabilities and details they found in the process.

In these competitions, I have tended to specialize in forensics and networking, but more recently I have found interest in cryptography and hardware security. In the future, I hope to post some writeups for any noteworthy challenges I solve in future CTFs and feel free to check [my CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/user/41176) to see any CTFs that I compete in.


As of writing this, some CTF accomplishments I am proud of are:
- National Cybersecurity Scholar
- 2 Time Finalist CSAW RED
- 2 Time Winner Maryland Cyber Challenge
- 2nd Place UMDCTF
- 3rd Place JerseyCTF
- High School Winner RedpwnCTF
- Top 50 Platinum Division CyberPatriot
