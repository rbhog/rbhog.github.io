# ![me](/me.png) Hi, I'm Rithvik

I am currently studying Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.

My interests include robotics and cybersecurity, both of which I have been pursuing since high school.

Most recently, I worked as an Undergraduate Researcher in the CyberGIS Center where I worked on writing JupyterLab extensions for kernel management and navigation.

If you ever want to talk about robotics or hardware security, feel free to contact me at <ins>**rbhogavilliATgmail.com**</ins> and check out my resume [**here**](/23resume.pdf).
