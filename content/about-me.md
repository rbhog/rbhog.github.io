# Hi, I'm Rithvik


I am currently studying Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. My interests include autonomy and embedded software, both of which I have been pursuing since high school.

In my free time, I enjoy watching F1 and breaking my configs while installing new libraries.

I am currently an Avionics Software Intern at [**Blue Origin**](https://www.blueorigin.com/), where I am working on the camera software for the New Glenn rocket. I am also a member of [**The Illinois Space Society**](https://www.illinoisspacesociety.org/), where I am on the GNC and Software teams for our Spaceshot.

If you ever want to talk about robotics or hardware security, feel free to contact me at <ins>**rbhogavilliATgmail.com**</ins> and check out my resume [**here**](/resume.pdf).
